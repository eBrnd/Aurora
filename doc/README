                 Aurora

I think this time I've found language and libraries that allow me to comfortably
write an irc bot I can stick to for a couple of years.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prerequisites:
 * lua 5.x with the following modules/libraries:
 * luasocket
 * copas
 * lrexlib-pcre
 * luajson (More or less optional, depending on what modules you want to use.)
 * lualogging


Installation:
  Huh? Create you config and run aurora.lua:
  
  # cp config.example.lua config.lua
  # lua aurora.lua

	When using luarocks you may want to call
	`lua --lluarocks.loader aurora.lua` instead to be able to use those.

The Mailing Module:
In order for the mail module to work, you need to set up several things.
First, you need offlineimap. It should be configured so that when it's callled
without parameters, it fetches mail and puts it into some directory.

Make your mail module's mail directory point to the "new" folder of the
desired mailbox, for example "~/Aurora_Mail/INBOX/new".

For sending out mail, the console program "mail" is needed, so you need to
take whatever steps necessary for that to work. For the sake of the internet,
please choose "from" and "to" addresses that actually exist.


Developer notes:
	When writing your own module, please have a look at modules/dummy.lua
	for the interface specification.


Troubleshooting:
  Problem:  "lua: attempt to yield across metamethod/C-call boundary" because
            copas tries to yield in its send routine. Most entertaining since
            restructuring the connection handling non-deterministically solved
            the problem until I connected to yet another network.
            
  Solution: This behaviour seems to originate from some high-throughput
            randomized (yay!) optimization in copas. I solved this by removing
            the following lines from the send() function in copas.lua:

            if (math.random(100) > 90) then
                _writing_log[client] = os.time()
                coroutine.yield(client, _writing)
            end
            
            I this will most certainly not affect Aurora, since irc throughput
            is limited on every irc server/network I know of, but I am not sure
            why the error occurs in the first place and the copas developers
            haven't responded to my bug report yet, so be careful.
